# shellfish
Plugin your configured problem domain into a generic algorithm framework.

Currently only the depth-first-search is implemented, but seems to work well for the Knight Tour and N Queens of small enough sizes, and solving multiple-solution sudoku puzzles (see test examples) 

Pre-detonated ALPHA - Use at your own risk!

See comments in src/shellfish/dfs/core.clj and working examples in test/shellfish/dfs
